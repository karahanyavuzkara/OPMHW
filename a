Case Study: Designing an Operating System for Smart Watch Functions
Smartwatches have become indispensable companions in the realm of wearable technology, offering a compact yet powerful interface for users to stay connected, track fitness, and manage their digital lives. However, existing operating systems often fail to fully harness the potential of these devices, necessitating the development of a specialized OS tailored specifically for smartwatches.
Goal
The primary goal is to design an operating system that seamlessly integrates with the compact form factor of smartwatches, prioritizing user experience through intuitive interface design, efficient resource management, and seamless connectivity with other devices. This OS aims to enhance the functionality of smartwatches by offering advanced health tracking features, customizable personalization options, and robust security measures to safeguard user data and privacy. Additionally, the OS should support over-the-air updates to ensure continuous improvement and adaptation to evolving user needs and technological advancements
Phase 1: Microkernel Architecture
•	Efficient Resource Utilization: Smartwatches are constrained by limited hardware resources such as processing power, memory, and battery life.
•	Enhanced Security: Security is paramount in smartwatch operating systems, especially considering the sensitive health and personal data they often handle.
•	Flexibility and Customization: Smartwatches serve diverse user needs, ranging from fitness tracking to communication and productivity. A microkernel architecture offers greater flexibility and customization options, allowing developers to easily add or remove features without impacting the core system stability.
